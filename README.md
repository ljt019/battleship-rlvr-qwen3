# battleship-rlvr-qwen3

Just a fun little learning project, I want to try fine-tuning my first LLM. RL (Reinforced Learning) is very popular right now, and particularly RLVR (Reinforced Learning with Verifible Rewards). Battleship seemed like a fun way to have verifible rewards and has the opportunity to teach me a lot about reward shaping for LMs.
